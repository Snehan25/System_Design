# <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">What is LLD ?</mark>

DSA --> Has many algorithms --> Ex: Search an Element in an array 
                                |
                                |---> If array sorted then BS
                                |
                                |---> If array unsorted then LS

So, DSA concepts are used to solve ~={blue}Isolated Problems=~.
                             |--> Ex: Searching an element in array ~={red}(Problem)=~
                             |            BS or LS ~={green}(Solution)=~
                             |
                             |--> Sorting an Array ~={red}(Problem)=~.
                             |      Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Insertion Sort, etc ~={green}(Solution)=~


~={cyan}LLD involves building a complete application around one or multiple DSA concepts.=~


**Let's understand this concept further by a story.**

# <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">LLD vs DSA Story</mark>

There are two friends, <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Anurag</mark>                               &                           <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Maurya</mark>

company called          |-->~={red}Do not Know LLD=~                                      |--> ~={green}Knows LLD=~
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Quick Ride</mark>
(Similar to Uber, Ola, etc)
(Ride Booking Platform)

##### **Let's look at perspective of both(Anurag & Maurya) solving the same problem.**

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Anurag's Approach</mark> --> Asked to figure out how to build Quick Ride Application. (By Manager)
| ~={green}DSA ✔️=~
|~={red} LLD❌=~
| --> **Thinks about the problem from a DSA perspective focusing on writing Algorithms.**


#### <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">Problem Identification</mark>

- ~={red}**Problem 1:**=~ <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">Finding the path from source to destination.</mark>
- ~={blue}Anurag models the city as a graph, where intersection are nodes & roads are edges.

![[Pasted image 20250513133544.png|500]]

- ~={blue}User --> Source to Destination --> Find shortest distance=~
- ~={blue} To find shortest distance --> Anurag uses Dijkstra Algorithm=~

~={yellow}**Problem 1 Solved.**=~

- **~={red}Problem 2:=~** <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">Assigning a rider to user</mark>
- ~={blue}U --> user's location
  Concentric circle --> Denotes nearby locations

![[Pasted image 20250513134442.png|300]]

- ~={blue}Map a priority queue corresponding every user.

 ![[Pasted image 20250513134517.png|250]]
- ~={blue}Put the nearby riders for that user in heap(PQ).
- When we pop the heap, we will get the closest rider & we will assign it to user.=~

~={yellow}**Problem 2 Solved.**=~

#### <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">Manager's Feedback</mark>

~={9}Anurag's manager tells him that what he solved were just algorithms, not an application. Anurag missed critical aspects of building a real-world application:=~

- ~={blue}Identifying the ~={purple}**objects or entities=~** in the application.
- Defining the ~={purple}**relationships=~** between these objects and how they interact.
- Considering **~={purple}data security=~** (e.g., hiding user/rider phone numbers after a ride).
- Integrating features like **~={purple}notifications.=~**
- Integrating services like **~={purple}payment gateways.=~**
- Most importantly, how the application will ~={purple}**handle millions of users and scale.=~=~**

~={9}Anurag jumped directly into algorithms (DSA) without considering the overall application structure.
=~
<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Maurya's Approach (DSA Expert, LLD Expert)</mark>

~={9}Maurya, who knows both ~={green}DSA and LLD=~, approaches the problem differently. He believes building the application's structure (LLD) must come first, with DSA coming much later.=~

1. ~={blue} **~={purple}Identify Objects/Entities:=~** Maurya starts by identifying the core objects or entities in the application.
- User (the one booking the ride).
- Rider (the one providing the ride).
-  Location.
- Other entities like Notification and Payment gateway.

2. ~={blue}**~={purple}Define Relationships:=~** He then figures out how these objects are related and will interact (e.g., how a user interacts with a rider, how a rider interacts with a location).=~

3. ~={blue}Consider Application-Level Concerns:
- **~={purple}Data Security:=~** How to handle sensitive data like phone numbers securely.
- **~={purple}Scalability:=~** How to build the application so it can sustain and handle millions of users without breaking.
- Integrating external services like **~={purple}notifications and payment gateways=~**.=~

4. ~={blue}**~={purple}Apply DSA (Later):=~** Only after designing the application's structure and considering these factors does Maurya think about the specific algorithms (like finding the shortest path or rider mapping) that Anurag focused on initially.=~

~={9}This comparison shows that LLD is the framework or structure upon which the application is built, and DSA is a tool used within that framework to solve specific technical problems.=~

# <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Three Pillars of LLD</mark>

~={9}When building an application and creating its Low-Level Design, LLD primarily focuses on three key areas:=~

~={red}1. **Scalability=~**
- ~={blue}Ensuring the application **~={purple}can sustain and handle millions of users=~** as it grows.
- How easily **~={purple}new features can be integrated=~** and the **~={purple}application can scale=~**.=~

~={red}2. **Maintainability=~**
- ~={blue}Writing code that is **~={purple}easy to maintain=~**.
- Integrating **~={purple}new features should not break existing functionality=~**.
- Requires **~={purple}minimum effort to integrate new code=~**.
- Code should be easily **~={purple}debuggable=~** (easy to find and fix bugs).
	The goal is minimum bugs, acknowledging that 0% bugs is impossible.=~

~={red}3. **Reusability=~**
- ~={blue}Writing code that is highly **~={purple}reusable=~**.
- Creating components or algorithms that are **~={purple}application-independent=~**.
- Follows a **~={purple}"Plug and Play"=~** model where code can be easily moved to and work in different applications.
- Code should not be **~={purple}"tightly coupled"=~** or fixed only for one specific application.=~

~={9}**Examples:**=~

- ~={9} **Notifications/Payment Gateways:** These are general functionalities that can be integrated into any application (Quick Ride, Zomato, Swiggy).=~

- ~={9}**Rider Mapping Algorithm**: The core logic for assigning a delivery person (rider, delivery boy, delivery partner) to a user, restaurant, or order is a generic concept used in ride-hailing, food delivery (Zomato, Swiggy), e-commerce delivery (Amazon), and grocery delivery (Blinkit). A reusable algorithm for this mapping can be applied across different platforms with minimal changes.=~

# <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">What is NOT LLD: High-Level Design (HLD)</mark>

~={9}It's important not to confuse LLD with High-Level Design (HLD). While both are part of system design, they focus on different aspects.=~

**~={purple}HLD (High-Level Design) focuses on the System Architecture=~**. ~={9}It deals with broader, system-wide concerns that LLD typically does not.=~

~={9}HLD focuses on questions like:
- The application's **~={purple}Tech Stack=~** (e.g., using Java Spring Boot).
- The choice of **~={purple}Database=~** (SQL, NoSQL, or a hybrid model).
- How **~={purple}Servers=~** will scale to handle bulk traffic by easily expanding and contracting.
- **~={purple}Cost Optimization=~**, specifically minimizing the monetary cost of running servers (e.g., on AWS) by ensuring they scale efficiently based on user load.=~

~={9}In an **~={purple}HLD interview=~**, you typically focus on creating an **~={purple}architectural design and system design diagrams, writing almost negligible code.=~** This is different from LLD, where you think about the structure of the actual code and create diagrams like class diagrams.=~

~={9}Using the Quick Ride example, HLD questions would involve choosing the tech stack, deciding on the database, and planning server scaling and cost optimization.=~

##### ~={9}The Relationship Between HLD, LLD, and DSA=~

~={9}•All **three (HLD, LLD, DSA) are used together to build a complete application or software**.
•**HLD** focuses on the **System Architecture**.
•**LLD** focuses on the **structure of the code**.
•**DSA** is a tool that **LLD uses to solve problems within the application's code structure.**=~
##### **A key takeaway analogy is:"~={red}If DSA is the brain of an application, LLD is the skeleton.=~"**
